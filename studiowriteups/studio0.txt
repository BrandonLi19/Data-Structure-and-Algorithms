Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question PS1: 
1.Similar straight lines and curves 2. Running quadratic needs more time than linear 3. Because quadratic.java contains 2 loops, which need more time to run.

Question PS2:
Because if there is only one loop, the computer only needs to calculate n times and it can calculate it really fast. If there are 2 loops, the computer needs to calculate n^2 times, which need more time and plotted value on X-axis can be bigger.

Question PS3: 
If ticker.tick() is in the inner loop, the plot will be a curve, and the value will be greater. If ticker.tick() is in the outer loop, the plot will be a straight line. So it 
affects both shape if the curve and plotted value.

Question PS4: 
The value of ticks = 3n^2 + 3n +1 and the shape is a quadratic function

Question PS5: 
Deleting each ticks in inner loop will decrease the value by n^2

Question A1:
1.Both plots look like horizontal, but tick more straight. each iteration cost same ticks and similar time.
2.Each spot represent the tick and time of one operation
3.It doesn't matter. No matter what n is, adding two numbers takes the same time.

Question A2:
1.If the length of the data is bigger, it will take more time to allocate it.
2.No, the line of code takes more time when this.n becomes bigger.

Question A3:
No,  ticks represents the operation of loop, but the time represents the time of allocation. They are different

Question A4:
1.Yes 2.If ticker.tick(n), ticks represent the operation of allocation, thus the time and the ticks are more similar. Allocate space for data by number of bits.

Question A5:
1.The team writes down decimal number.
2.Decimal:int(lg(x))+1 
tally marks:[x/5] 
3.x>5

Question A6:
1.2^n < X < 2^(n+1) , n is the number of marks. 2, ratio =n/ (int(lg(x))+1)

Question A7:
Choosing decimal is more efficient, because we can use few marks to represent large number.

Question C1:
1. It is a linear equation line   2. y= ax+b best fits the growth rate of this curve.

Question C2:
Discontinuities mean when the length of the array is not enough, computer will double the length of the array, which will increase ticks dramatically.

Question C3:
Ensure X will be located close to 2^n, but not larger than 2^n. Doubling will be a good choice.
No,because we don't know the time cost.

Question D1:
T(n) = n*(n+1)/2 ,yes

Question D2:
T(2^k)=2^k-1
